On your birthday, don't worry about... about the odd grey hair! Just enjoy your day, in style.
OLD is an abbreviation for Obsolete, Lazy and Dull. Congratulations for turning one year OLDer.
When I look at you, I cant think of the worst part of getting older because everything about it seems equally bad. Happy birthday.
Growing old may be a daunting task, but at least the number of your age is finally greater than the size of your ass! Have a Happy Birthday!
Happy birthday, old friend. Remember to keep smiling while you still have teeth!
Happy birthday, dear friend. May you find the courage and strength to blow out all those candles!
